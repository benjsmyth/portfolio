<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>My interest in software engineering began while I was studying post-secondary music.</p>
<p>At the time, I felt disappointed with the program I was enrolled in, while a slight interest towards programming often lingered in the back of my mind. I don't really recall what first committed me to learning; one day, the inspiration found me. I began teaching myself the very basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I followed <a class="link" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"  target="_blank">The Odin Project<img class="new-window-icon" src="../images/open_in_new_icon_138327.svg" height="10rem"></a>closely; I built a few interesting projects.</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to complete missing high school prerequisites, and enrolled in Computer Science at the University of Guelph.</p>
